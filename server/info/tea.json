    "desc": "TEA\n\n Tea production, cultivation of the tea plant, usually done in large commercial operations. The plant, a species of evergeen (Camellia sinensis), is valued for its young leaves and leaf buds, from which the tea beverage is produced. This article treats the cultivation of the tea plant. For information on the processing of tea and the history of its use, see the article tea.\n\nVarieties\n\n The natural habitat of the tea plant is considered to be within the fan-shaped area between the Nagaland, Manipur, and Lushai hills along the Assam-Myanmar (Burma) frontier in the west; through to China, probably as far as Zhejiang province in the east; and from this line south through the hills of Myanmar and Thailand into Vietnam.\n\n The three main varieties of the tea plant, China, Assam, and Cambodia, each occur in their most distinct form at the extremes of the fan-shaped area. There are an infinite number of hybrids between the varieties; such crosses can be seen in almost any tea field.The China variety, a multistemmed bush growing as high as 9 feet (2.75 metres), is a hardy plant able to withstand cold winters and has an economic life of at least 100 years. When grown at an altitude near that of Darjiling (Darjeeling) and Sri Lanka (Ceylon), it produces teas with valuable flavour during the season’s second flush or growth of new shoots.\n\nCultivation\n\nThree considerations in planning a tea estate are climate, soil acidity, and labour availability.A suitable climate has a minimum annual rainfall of 45 to 50 inches (1,140 to 1,270 mm), with proper distribution. If there is a cool season, with average temperatures 20 °F (11 °C) or more below those of the warm season, the growth rate will decrease and a dormant period will follow, even when the cool season is the wetter one."
